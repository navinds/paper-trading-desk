description: >-
  Exit Planner for NSE intraday trades. Sets your stop-loss and your target
  before you enter, so you know when to get out. Reads the entry from
  trader-entry (or a price you give), puts the stop at the opening-range
  midpoint by default (or the range low, your price, a percent, or a
  multiple of the ATR), rounds it DOWN to the NSE tick size for the stock's
  price band (Rs 0.01, 0.05, 0.10, 0.50, 1 or 5), and sets the target at 2R
  (or 1R, or your price). Refuses a stop at or above the entry, a target at
  or below it, or a stop too tight to survive the spread, and says why.
  Flat by 15:10 IST (before Zerodha's 15:25 MIS square-off). Writes
  trader/plan.json for the Time Machine, the Budget Manager and Price
  Alerts. Long side only. Use when the user says "where's my stop", "set my
  SL and target", "plan the exit", "when do I get out", "stop loss", "what's
  my R", "risk reward", or right after /trader-entry triggers, before
  /trader-timemachine.

# trader-exit

The Exit Planner decides how a trade ends before it starts. The stop is where
the setup has failed. The target is where you take what you came for. Both
are set BEFORE the entry, written down and handed on, so nobody has to decide
anything in the middle of a fast move. A stop is a plan, not a guarantee: a
gap, a fast market or a circuit can fill past it. Most individual intraday
traders lose money, and a neat plan does not change that.

`${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` below is this skill's folder (where this SKILL.md lives).

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/exit.py" plan                          # trader/entry.json: midpoint stop, 2R target
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/exit.py" plan --stop or-mid --target 1R --write
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/exit.py" plan --stop atr:1.5           # needs the session's bars (Yahoo or --offline)
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/exit.py" plan --symbol RELIANCE --entry 1227.80 --or-high 1223.40 --or-low 1207.30
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/exit.py" show                          # the current trader/plan.json
```

Other flags: `--flat-by 15:10`, `--json`, `--now "2026-10-19 09:50"` (IST),
`--entry PRICE` with a waiting entry.json to plan ahead, `--setup level`,
`--offline FILE` (a saved Yahoo chart JSON for an ATR stop).

## What it reads and writes

| file | what |
| --- | --- |
| `trader/entry.json` | the trigger from trader-entry: symbol, entry price, time, bar, opening range |
| `trader/config.json` | `flat_by` (15:10) and `min_reward_risk` (1.0: a note here, trader-risk enforces it) |
| Yahoo chart API | only for an `atr:K` stop: the session's bars up to the entry bar |
| `trader/plan.json` | with `--write`: entry, stop and its rule, target and its R, risk a share, reward:risk, tick, flat by. trader-timemachine, trader-budget and trader-alerts read it |

## Stops and targets

| stop | where it goes |
| --- | --- |
| `or-mid` | the opening-range midpoint (the default for an opening-range breakout) |
| `or-low` | the opening-range low: wider, so fewer shares for the same max loss |
| `price:X` | your price |
| `pct:X` | X percent under the entry |
| `atr:K` | K times the 14-bar ATR under the entry, on the session's bars up to the entry bar |

A level setup has no opening range to lean on, so it needs a stop you name.

- **Tick size.** NSE prices move in ticks set by the price band (the ladder
  in force since April 2025): under Rs 250, Rs 0.01; Rs 250 to 1,000, Rs 0.05;
  above 1,000 to 5,000, Rs 0.10; above 5,000 to 10,000, Rs 0.50; above 10,000
  to 20,000, Rs 1; above 20,000, Rs 5. The stop rounds AWAY from the entry
  (down, for a long); the target rounds half up. NSE sets each stock's band
  from the previous month's last close, and the tool uses the entry price:
  near a band edge, check the tick in Kite's order window.
- **Refused, with the reason.** A stop at or above the entry. A target at or
  below it. A risk under 0.05% of the price or two ticks: too tight to
  survive the spread. An entry.json that has not triggered (unless you give
  `--entry`). A short.
- **Flat by.** 15:10 IST by default (or `flat_by` in the config). Out by then,
  win or lose: MIS is intraday, and Zerodha squares off open MIS positions
  itself from 15:25, charging Rs 50 + GST an order for it. A flat-by at or
  after 15:25 gets a warning; an entry at or after the flat-by is refused.

## Steps

1. Run it right after `/trader-entry` triggers. Before that, `--entry PRICE`
   plans ahead at the level you expect.
2. Use the default stop for an opening-range breakout unless the user names
   another. A level setup needs one: ask.
3. Run `exit.py plan --write`. Read back the entry, the stop and its rule,
   the target and its rule, the risk a share, reward:risk and flat by.
4. If it refuses, say the reason and the fix (a wider stop, a farther
   target). Never loosen anything on your own.
5. Say once that the stop is a plan, not a guarantee.
6. Hand off to `/trader-timemachine` to replay the plan, then `/trader-budget`
   to size it to the max loss per trade. Offer `/trader-alerts` for the stop,
   the target and the flat-by time.

## Example: RELIANCE, Monday 19 October 2026

The entry is ₹1,227.80 at 9:50 AM (the 9:45 bar, bar 6) and the opening
range is ₹1,207.30 to ₹1,223.40. `exit.py plan --stop or-mid --target 1R --write`:

```
Exit plan: RELIANCE long, Mon 2026-10-19, opening-range breakout on 5-minute bars
  Entry         ₹1,227.80 at 9:50 AM (bar 6)
  Stop          ₹1,215.30  opening-range midpoint: (₹1,223.40 + ₹1,207.30) / 2 = ₹1215.35, rounded down to the ₹0.1 tick
  Target        ₹1,240.30  1R (one times the risk)
  Risk a share  ₹12.50 (1.02% of the entry)
  Reward:risk   1.0
  Flat by       15:10 IST, win or lose: no overnight hold (MIS)
```

The midpoint ₹1,215.35 is not on RELIANCE's ₹0.10 tick, so the stop goes to
₹1,215.30. The default 2R target would be 1,227.80 + 2 x 12.50 = ₹1,252.80.
trader-budget then sizes it: a ₹500 max loss, charges included, buys 36 shares.

## Rules

- The stop and the target are set before the entry, never after.
- Never move a stop further from the entry once the trade is on.
- Plain numbers only: entry, stop, target, risk a share, reward:risk. It
  never prints a P&L or a return.
- Nothing here promises winning trades or money. A 1R target is not a
  prediction that the price gets there.

## What it never does

It never places an order, never sizes a position, never widens a stop to
make a plan pass, and never calls a stop a guarantee.

## Safety

- Education and tooling, not financial advice. A PASS is a rules check, not a recommendation. This pack is not a SEBI-registered adviser or research analyst.
- Paper trading by default (`"paper": true`). Zerodha has no paper account, so paper means simulated fills; going live is the user's own decision, in their own config.
- Nothing in this pack places an order except trader-broker, and only when all three hold: trader-risk
  passed that exact order today, the user typed an explicit yes for that one order in the chat, and the
  user clicked Allow once on Claude's own card because the Kite order tools need approval. Never allow an
  order tool without asking.
- No F&O, margin (MTF or MIS leverage) or short selling unless the config allows it and the user confirms.
- Kite logs in through Zerodha's own login page. Never ask for, read or repeat a password, PIN, TOTP or API secret.
